### `Alpha Release! Not stable. Back up data regularly using Excel Export.`

## Introduction
When I was looking around for a tool that would help me keep track of diverse portfolios it was hard to find a good, free solution that I could trust. For that need I built this tool.

### Portfolios and Asset Types
You can keep track of Cash assets (and debts), equity stocks, ETFs, Bitcoin, and Ethereum with Peace Tools. Simply create a portfolio and add your transactions. Then use the Performance tab to analyze the portfolio over time.

### Performance Analysis
In the Performance tab you can mix and match portfolios you've saved with each other and with symbols on the market. Set whatever time range you're looking for. Choose between sum and compare modes. Sum mode sums the values you're analyzing, which is useful for meta-analysis of your portfolios overall. Compare mode plots values side by side, useful for looking at stocks and similar portfolios.

### Chart Update Flow
To help performance this app caches aggressively and does most networking and data shaping in web workers. This leads to a bit more complex flow from clicking "Compute" to seeing the data plotted. This diagram may help navigate the structure.
